This crawler behaves like a normal web crawler and does not try to mimic a web browser in any way.
It downloads every resource from a set of domains in order to clone the site for other applications
such as indexing, searching, scraping, and link analysis.

fetcher.py is single threaded for the most part and does very little non-blocking I/O.

This crawler instance is designed to be deployed on a single computing instance. Any number of crawler instances
may be deployed - each on their own computing instance.  Each instance has its own User-Agent and has no knowledge of
other instances in operation.  All instances for a crawl job share the same frontier.

The crawler must be initialized using CrawlJobInitializer and the Frontier manager must be started before this script
can run.
